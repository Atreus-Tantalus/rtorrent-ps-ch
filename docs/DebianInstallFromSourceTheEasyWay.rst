Debian Install From Source - The Easy Way
=========================================

.. contents:: **Contents**


Introduction
------------

This guide will show only the required methods / commands to get ``rTorrent-PS-CH`` and ``pyrocore`` utilities up and running in ``tmux``. It's really easy with the help of the amazing build scripts created by ``pyroscope``.

Note that building process of ``rTorrent-PS-CH`` has been changed (simplified) as of ``v1.6.0``, still installing a compiled build into the `system <#install-it-into-system>`_ in the end is the preferred way.


Installing build dependencies
-----------------------------

First, you need to install a few **required** packages â€” **and no, this is not optional in any way**. They require about ``300 MB`` disk space. These steps must be performed by the ``root`` user (i.e. in a root shell, or by writing ``sudo`` before the actual command):

.. code-block:: shell

   apt-get update
   apt-get install sudo tmux coreutils binutils build-essential subversion git time \
       chrpath pkg-config libssl-dev libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev locales libcppunit-dev \
       zlib1g-dev autoconf automake libtool libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev curl ruby ruby-dev mc \
       python python-dev python-virtualenv python-pip python-setuptools python-pkg-resources
   gem install fpm


Note about ``tmux``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After that all you need is to place a `.tmux.conf <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chros73/rtorrent-ps_setup/master/ubuntu-14.04/home/chros73/.tmux.conf>`_ like that in your home directory (can be ``root`` or a regular user) and you can already run ``tmux``: 

.. code-block:: shell

   cd ~; curl -sLSO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chros73/rtorrent-ps_setup/master/ubuntu-14.04/home/chros73/.tmux.conf
   tmux

There is only 1 crucial option (along with the other useful ones) in that ``.tmux.conf``: ``set -g default-terminal "screen-256color"``. This is responsible for getting 256 color support. **No matter** what other tutorials / guides / intructions say about the ``TERM`` environment variable: **you shouldn't set it**! You will experience strange rendering problems! Although this will result that ``rTorrent-PS-CH`` won't start in a terminal window, but that's not a problem since we always run it in ``tmux``. (`Read more <https://sanctum.geek.nz/arabesque/term-strings/>`_ about it.)



Compiling ``rTorrent-PS-CH`` from source
-----------------------------------

Multiple versions can be supported or just the latest stable ``git`` version. If patches for multiple version can be found inside the ``patches`` directory then ``build.sh`` will compile the latest release version, in this case ``git`` option can be passed to it to build ``git`` version. If ``ONLY_GIT_LT_RT`` is set to ``true`` in ``build.sh`` script then it will always build ``git`` version.


For regular user
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It has to be compiled this way first. Build script creates local CPU optimized code by default.

It will build ``rTorrent-PS-CH`` binary including some libraries into ``~/lib/rtorrent-ps-ch*`` directory and create symlink to it in ``~/bin/`` directory.

.. code-block:: shell

   mkdir -p ~/src/; cd ~/src/
   git clone https://github.com/chros73/rtorrent-ps-ch.git
   cd rtorrent-ps-ch
   time nice -n 19 ./build.sh ch

If you want to turn off optimization for some reason (e.g. packaging the build) it can be done by rebuilding it with:

.. code-block:: shell

   OPTIMIZE_BUILD=no time nice -n 19 ./build.sh ch


Install it into system
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You need ``root access`` for this.

It installs (copies) the compiled ``rTorrent-PS-CH`` binary including some libraries into ``/opt/rtorrent-ps-ch*`` directory and creates  symlink to it in ``/usr/local/bin/`` directory.

.. code-block:: shell

   sudo ./build.sh install


Creating deb package
""""""""""""""""""""

You can even ``create a package`` of an unoptimized, installed build with ``fpm`` if you like (so you can distribute it later):

.. code-block:: shell

   DEBFULLNAME="yourname" DEBEMAIL="youremailaddress" ./build.sh pkg2deb

You should copy the resulted ``*.deb`` package from ``/tmp/rtorrent-ps-ch-dist`` to somewhere safe.


Creating Arch Linux package
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

You can even ``create a package`` of an unoptimized, installed build with ``pacman`` (``fpm`` from the AUR should be used!) if you like (so you can distribute it later):

.. code-block:: shell

   DEBFULLNAME="yourname" DEBEMAIL="youremailaddress" ./build.sh pkg2pacman

You should copy the resulted ``*.tar.xz`` package from ``/tmp/rtorrent-ps-ch-dist`` to somewhere safe.


Vanilla build
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can even build an optimized version of vanilla ``rtorrent`` (only including necessary patches if there's any).

It will build the binary including some libraries into ``~/lib/rtorrent-ps-ch-vanilla*`` directory and create symlink to it in ``~/bin/`` directory. (Note that installing, packaging a vanilla build is not supported.)

.. code-block:: shell

   time nice -n 19 ./build.sh vanilla


If all went well
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Check the result by running ``rtorrent`` (you don't need a config file for this) in a ``tmux`` window, not terminal window!

You can delete the ``~/src/rtorrent-ps-ch/`` directory later if all went well with:

.. code-block:: shell

   cd ~ && [ -d ~/src/rtorrent-ps-ch/ ] && rm -rf ~/src/rtorrent-ps-ch/



Install ``pyrocore`` utils for regular user
-------------------------------------------

You should run these under your normal user account:

.. code-block:: shell

   cd ~ && mkdir -p ~/bin ~/.local
   git clone "https://github.com/pyroscope/pyrocore.git" ~/.local/pyroscope
   ~/.local/pyroscope/update-to-head.sh
   touch ~/.bash_completion
   grep /\.pyroscope/ ~/.bash_completion >/dev/null || \
       echo >>.bash_completion ". ~/.pyroscope/bash-completion.default"
   . /etc/bash_completion

You can check whether all went well with:

.. code-block:: shell

   pyroadmin --version

If you want to update ``pyrocore`` utils later:

.. code-block:: shell

   cd ~/.local && tar -czf pyroscope-$(date +'%Y-%m-%d').tar.gz pyroscope    # make backup first
   cd ~ && ~/.local/pyroscope/update-to-head.sh                              # update it
   pyroadmin --version                                                       # check for success


Summary
-------

It's really that simple, it only took about 30 minutes.
